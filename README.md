The weather app website homework


*get a good api to help you with the week or week weather forcasting.

*build my HTLM, CSS, then JavaScript.

*Had to create eventlisteners for just pressing enter instead of clicking for I was basing it on a phone type of funciton
you cannot click on a phone but enter on your keyboard your phone displays.

*I wanted to implete the api for city data, weather data and have the informiton display with in the small diplay icon I made.

*I want it be be easy for them to select the refesh button or F5 fuction if on their PC>

How to make sure my api was retriving data correctly via my fetch fuctions.

*I had to make sure both API fetch city data and weather data functions were responding to their fetch commands.
One I was able to do that I implemented the refresh function to let the user select another city.

* I use some the icons for changing according to the weather temp.
