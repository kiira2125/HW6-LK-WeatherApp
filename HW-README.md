# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Your Task

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Usein the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. Read through the documentation for setup and usage instructions. You will use `localStorage` to store any persistent data. For more information on how to work with the OpenWeather API, refer to the [Full-Stack Blog on how to use API keys](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys).

## About Me O_O

```
As someone who loves outdoors activities and loves to traval to many places. I want to always be able to see how the weather will be for various cities.
In knowing how the weather is estimate to be, it will allow me to better prepare myself for my trip and be prepare for the unexpected weather that might have a low chance of occurring, but never wrong in preparing for that surprise weather condition.

## The approve criteria for this homework is

<p> 
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs, and when the user or I search for a city, I will be  presented with current and future weather forecast for that city in search. When you search any city it will added to the search history.

When the user views the current weather conditions for that specific city 
then that specific city is added to the search history.

The users will also get weather conditions for that city in search.
The users will be presented with the city information such as: city name, the weather data, and an icons to represent the weather conditions.

Which these icons will indicate the weather, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV data.

UV data will give a color to indicate the whether and its conditions to either be favorable, moderate, or server.

User will get a future 6-day forecast and will display the date, the icon to represent the weather status, the temperature status, and the humidity status.

User will have ability to search history for previous city search.
